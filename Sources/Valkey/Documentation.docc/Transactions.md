# Transactions

Perform atomic operations.

Transactions allow you to group multiple commands into an atomic operation. A request sent by another client isn't processed in the middle of the execution of a transaction. Valkey uses the commands `MULTI` and `EXEC` to setup and execute a transaction. After initiating a transaction with `MULTI`, commands return a simple string `QUEUED` to indicate the server queued the commands. When the client sends the `EXEC` command, the server executes all the queued commands and returns an array with their results. 

Because of this custom behaviour valkey-swift provides extra support for executing transactions. The API is very similar to the pipelining function which accepts a parameter pack of commands, detailed in <doc:Pipelining>.

```swift
try await valkeyClient.withConnection { connection in
    let results = try await connection.transaction(
        SET("foo", value: "100"),
        LPUSH("queue", elements: ["foo"])
    )
    let lpushResponse = try results.1.get()
}
```

### Rollbacks

Valkey does not support rollbacks of transactions for simplicity and performance reasons. 

### Check and set

The transaction command `WATCH` is used to add a check-and-set behaviour to Valkey transactions. This sets up a list of keys to WATCH, and if any changes to them are detected before the next transaction is executed on the same connection, then that transaction will fail.

For instance, imagine we wanted to atomically increment a counter (assuming we don't have the INCR command). A simple implementation might look like this:

```swift
// get value, otherwise default to 0
let value = try await connection.get("counter").map { Int(String(buffer: $0)) } ?? 0
try await connection.set("counter", String(value + 1))
```

Unfortunately this isn't a reliable solution as another client could attempt to increment the key "counter" in between the GET and SET commands, then the increment would be applied to the wrong value. By using WATCH and executing the SET inside a transaction we can avoid this. If the key is edited between the WATCH and SET, the transaction fails and throws a `ValkeyClientError(.transactionAborted)` error. When this occurs we know the key was edited between these two commands and we need to update the "counter" value before trying to call SET again, so we run the operation again.

```swift
while true {
    try await connection.watch(keys: ["counter"])
    let value = try await connection.get("counter").map { Int(String(buffer: $0)) } ?? 0
    do {
        let result = try await connection.transaction(
            SET("counter", String(value + 1))
        )
        // set was succesful break out of the while loop
        break
    } catch let error as ValkeyClientError where error.errorCode == .transactionAborted {
        // Cancelled SET because "counter" was edited after WATCH, try again
    }
}
```
