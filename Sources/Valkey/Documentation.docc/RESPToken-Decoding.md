# Decoding RESP

Decoding the contents of RESPToken

## Overview

The wire protocol valkey-swift uses is RESP3. It is simple, human readable and a fast protocol to parse. It can be used to serialize many different types including strings, integers, doubles, array and maps. More can be found out about RESP in the [Valkey Documentation](https://valkey.io/topics/protocol/).

We represent a raw RESP token using the type ``RESPToken``. A parsed RESP value is represented by the enum ``RESPToken/Value``. This includes cases for the different datatypes a RESP token can represent.

The majority of the Valkey commands return the Swift types equivalent to their expected response. eg `GET` returns a `ByteBuffer` containing the contents of the key, `STRLEN` returns the length of the contents as an `Int`. But there are a number of reasons for commands to not have a defined return type and in these cases a command may return the type ``RESPToken`` or one of the sequence types ``RESPToken/Array`` or ``RESPToken/Map``.

## Decoding RESPToken

A `RESPToken` contains the raw serialized bytes returned by the Valkey server. Valkey-swift introduces a protocol ``RESPTokenDecodable`` for types that can be decoded from a `RESPToken`. Many of Swift core types have been extended to conform to `RESPTokenDecodable`. There are two ways to decode a `RESPToken`. You can call ``RESPTokenDecodable/init(fromRESP:)``.

```swift
let string = String(fromRESP: respToken)
```

Or you can call the `RESPToken` method ``RESPToken/decode(as:)``. This can be chained onto the end of a command call eg `RPOP` can return a single value or an array of values so the function returns a `RESPToken` and the user should decode it based on whether they asked for multiple or a single value to be popped.

```swift
let string = try await valkeyClient.rpop("myList")?.decode(as: String.self)
```

## Decoding RESPToken.Array

When a command returns an array it is returned as an ``RESPToken/Array``. This can be to avoid the additional memory allocation of creating a Swift `Array` or because the array represents a more complex type. `RESPToken.Array` conforms to `Sequence` and its element type is a `RESPToken`. You can iterate over its contents and decode each element as follows.

```swift
let values = try await valkeyClient.smembers("mySet")
for value in values {
    let string = value.decode(as: String.self)
    print(string)
}
```

Alternatively if you don't mind the additional allocation you can decode as a Swift `Array`

```swift
let values = try await valkeyClient.smembers("mySet").decode(as: [String].self)
```

The type of each element of a `RESPToken.Array` is not fixed. It is possible for values in the same array to represent different types. Decoding different types from an array is done using either `RESPToken.Array` method ``RESPToken/Array/decodeElements(as:)`` or `RESPToken` method ``RESPToken/decodeArrayElements(as:)``. The following code decodes the first element of an array as a `String` and the second as an `Int`.

```swift
let (member, score) = respToken.decodeArrayElements(as: (String, Int).self)
```

## Decoding RESPToken.Map

When a command returns a dictionary it is returned as a ``RESPToken/Map``. This can be to avoid the additional memory allocation of creating a Swift `Dictionary`, or a more complex type is being represented. `RESPToken.Map` conforms to `Sequence` and its element type is a key value pair of two `RESPToken`. You can iterate over its contents and decode its elements as follows.

```swift
let values = try await client.configGet(parameters: ["*max-*-entries*"])
for (keyToken, valueToken) in values {
    let key = try keyToken.decode(as: String.self)
    let value = try valueToken.decode(as: String.self)
    ...
}
```

Alternatively if you don't mind the additional allocation you can decode as a Swift `Dictionary`

```swift
let values = try await client.configGet(parameters: ["*max-*-entries*"])
    .decode(as: [String: String].self)
```
